# Ditanks
Python pygame 2d singleplayer game about tanks

About game:
- This was my first big python project
- I created this game for fun when i was 15 years old (10th grade)
- It took me around 1 week to make it (3-5 hours a day)
- I used python library pygame for it
- All of collisions, camera movements, AI path generator was done from scratch by myself (that is why this project was a bit hard)
- Everything is just in 2 .py files (I know that it is not good)
- Around 2k lines of code

Game Features:
- Player hit points, bullets ricochet, ultimate power (teleportation)
- Enemy tanks AI (path generator, bullet trajectory)
- Map generator
- Progressively increasing level difficulty
- Game over score
- And so much more!
This was a very good project for me to learn and understand python
